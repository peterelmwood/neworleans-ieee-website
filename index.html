                <h4>
                    Opioid overdose is a leading cause of death in the United States. In fact, an estimated 2.5 million
                    people struggle with addiction to opioids and every day more than 115 people die from opioid
                    overdose, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The arrival of the coronavirus disease
                    (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated this formidable disease. Shelter-in-place orders have pushed
                    individuals battling sobriety into isolation and have decreased access to treatment and opportunity
                    for distraction from addictions. The addiction community is raising alarms that the current
                    epidemiological climate alone is a risk factor for substance abuse relapse, prompting the New York
                    Times to label the coronavirus pandemic “a national relapse trigger. Thus, social distancing is
                    potentially concealing a surge of opioid abuse, and resulting morbidity and mortality, larger than
                    any we saw before. This growing crisis has policymakers, health care professionals, scientists and
                    others scrambling to find solutions to this national emergency. During an overdose, the respiratory
                    centers in the brain are suppressed. This leads to dangerous lowering of blood oxygen levels, loss
                    of consciousness, and eventually respiratory arrest and death. There are many initiatives to reduce
                    the death rate from opioid overdosing including providing naloxone, a medication that can rapidly
                    counteract and reverse the effects of opioids, to known drug users, their caregivers, and first
                    responders. Naloxone can be administered via intravenous infusion, intramuscular injection, or nasal
                    spray during an overdose. However, rescuers are often not present at the time of overdose. Clearly
                    there is a need for technologies to address these types of situations and opioid overdose, including
                    interventions against respiratory depression in isolated users. In response, Slack Enterprises and
                    T3SLA Innovations have created LifeWatch, a breakthrough device designed to detect and prevent a
                    potentially fatal effect that can occur in people using opioids. The device prevents respiratory
                    arrest and death from opioid overdose by monitoring blood oxygen in opioid recipients and prompting
                    them to breathe if oxygen falls below a certain level, while automatically administering Naloxone,
                    the reversal drug. The device also has an associated app that can notify emergency services. The key
                    components of the technology are: 1) a wrist-worn device that detects respiratory arrest based on
                    measures of blood oxygen levels, respiration rate, and heart rate; 2) a medication delivery device
                    that automatically administers Naloxone when respiratory arrest is detected, and 3) a companion app
                    that is installed on the user's smartphone to contact an emergency call center with the user's GPS
                    location when the system is triggered. The specific goals of this project have been designed to
                    demonstrate the feasibility of saving lives, validate the physiological measures obtained from the
                    connected wrist-worn wearable sensor, and evaluate technology acceptance from key stakeholders.
                    Slack Enterprises has already has already patented the process and demonstrated the capability to
                    build the other components of the system. A medical advisory board, consisting of doctors
                    specializing in addiction assists the team of engineers and scientists in the development of this
                    new technology, which the development team anticipates entering the testing phase mid-2021, and
                    project completion in early 2022.

                    Thomas Slack graduated from Loyola University New Orleans with a BS in Physics and a BA in
                    Communications. While at Loyola, Slack worked with Riley Mayes on a high-altitude conductivity
                    measurement experiment funded by NASA and the Louisiana Space Consortium, and continued that
                    research for over two years following graduation while working for a local tech firm as a design
                    engineer developing consumer-grade medical hardware. He began working with Mayes and John Whyte two
                    years ago to develop a solution geared towards addressing the mortality outcome of the nation’s
                    worsening opioid epidemic, which resulted in the team’s first patent submission earlier this year
                    for a device called “LifeWatch.” The trio founded a tech firm, T3SLA Innovations, which is headed by
                    Slack and continues to develop the hardware for the first round of devices, while awaiting funding
                    from the National Science Foundation.

                        John Whyte is a Mechanical Engineer with a background in Physics and Mathematics. During his
                        undergraduate years, Whyte conducted research under Dr. Martin McHugh exploring the phenomena of
                        quantum entanglement After constructing instrumentation that measured photon spin and counted
                        photon pairs, the team confirmed that the there was no evidence of local hidden variables and
                        that the interactions observed were truly non-local.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whyte has also conducted research with Mayes and Slack, where the objective of the experiment
                        was to measure the ionic conductivity of the atmosphere as a function of altitude. The team was
                        the first to achieve significant results and have since patented the device, which resembles a
                        modified Gerdien condenser. Research endeavors on atmospheric conductivity continued after well
                        after the close of the research program, with the group presenting their methods and results for
                        IEEE New Orleans Section in the Summer of 2018.

                        Whyte resides in the D.C. metropolitan area where he currently works in project management for a
                        high purity mechanical contracting company. Whyte’s main focus with the company is with new
                        biopharmaceutical and laboratory construction. Between 2019 and 2020, Whyte was instrumental in
                        helping construct the new Emergent Biosolutions campus in Baltimore, MD, where the first
                        COVID-19 vaccines are set to be produced This facility was part of the federal initiative
                        Operation Warp Speed, which aimed to accelerate construction of new facilities to meet the
                        increasing demand for new medicines to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. Whyte, along with Mayes and
                        Slack, is a founding member of T3SLA Innovations, and is credited with developing the first
                        LifeWatch concept for patent submission.
